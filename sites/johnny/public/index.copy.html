  	<h1>An Ode 2 Node</h1><br />
	<p>
		As a front-end developer, Javascript has become my second language. With Node.js, it may become my first.

	<p>
		For all of the gossip and gospel surrounding Node.js, a few things stand out: it's fast, it's fun, and it raised servers and networking protocols to the forefront of application development.
		And just in time, too!

	<p>
		Treat your traffic to custom servers, go with Node.js.

			True Story: when I was growing up, I was commanded to "speak when spoken to", and otherwise stay quiet. That's how became a listener.</p>

		<h2>Pre-processing</h2><br />

			<h1>OPEN SOURCERY</h1>
			<br />
	        <p>I am student and follower of open source software. No, I'm more like an open source citizen. I work exclusively with open source technology. I troll github <a href='https://github.com/joyent/node/network'>network graphs</a> to find forks and fixes.</p><br />
			<h2>Ugly Beginnings</h2><br />
			<p>
	          Like many of my peers, I began my journey hacking PHP CMSs and LAMP backends in the mid-aughts.
	          Today, I use dozens of open source projects in every website or application. From the operating system to browser libraries. 
			</p><br />
			<h2>Auto-Discovery</h2><br />
			<p>For me, 'professional development' is keeping track of what is going on in Open Source. I have to know!<br /><br />
				I love finding new projects, trying them, and watching them mature.
	          I use Github keep track of dozens of open source projects, and am very resourceful and finding and assessing projects new and old.
	          </p><br />
	        <h2>A few of my favorite Open Source projects:</h2><br />

  <div class='slide' id='history'>
        <p>
          Epiphanies about the future are what inspired me to become a programmer, specifically for browser and web technologies. 
          That journey began 5 years ago in Chicago, when I started experimenting with front-end development and PHP CMSs. I was 26.
          I have since worked as a freelance and contract developer, for interactive agencies, eCommerce sites, small business, non-profits, and individuals.
          I am also one of the founders of NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS, a digital video production agency.
        </p>
        <p>2004-2007 I managed IT and computer tutoring programs within the Chicago Public School 
          District, and at districts all over the greater Midwest. CPS is very large, and I worked at over a hundred schools, with faculties, staff, parents and students.
          I did that for 3 years. This experience, and my own experience in public school, inspire me to work for the future of public education.</p>
          <p>
            Prior to that, I held an assortment of jobs, in several industry: security, live event production... bartender, taxi driver.   
            My first job was delivering newspapers on a bike route. This is precisely the period that paperboy was a popular NES game.
