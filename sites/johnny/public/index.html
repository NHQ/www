          LAMP, Wordpress, Drupal, jQuery--Like so many others, I began my hacking on these.
          Today, I use dozens of open source modules in every website or application. From my server's OS to browser APIs.
          I use Github keep track of dozens of open source projects, and am extremely resourceful and finding projects new and old to meet the demands

        <p>
          Epiphanies about the future are what inspired me to become a programmer, specifically for browser and web technologies. 
          That journey began 5 years ago in Chicago, when I started experimenting with front-end development and PHP CMSs. I was 26.
          I have since worked as a freelance and contract developer, for interactive agencies, eCommerce sites, small business, non-profits, and individuals.
          I am also one of the founders of NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS, a digital video production agency.
        </p>
        <p>2004-2007 I managed IT and computer tutoring programs within the Chicago Public School 
          District, and at districts all over the greater Midwest. CPS is very large, and I worked at over a hundred schools, with faculties, staff, parents and students.
          I did that for 3 years. This experience, and my own experience in public school, inspire me to work for the future of public education.</p>
          <p>
            Prior to that, I held an assortment of jobs, in several industry: security, live event production... bartender, taxi driver.   
            My first job was delivering newspapers on a bike route. This is precisely the period that paperboy was a popular NES game.
